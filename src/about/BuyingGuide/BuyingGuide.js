                  Buying an essay can be a useful way to gain valuable help with
                  your writing skills and can be a great tool for improving
                  learning. However, you should never buy an essay to simply
                  submit as your own: not only will this reduce your own
                  learning, but even worse, this would be classed as academic
                  plagiarism. We recommend that if you are planning on buying an
                  essay, you should first try to find the help and support you
                  need from your own university or lecturer. However, if you
                  find that you can't get help and you are struggling with
                  writing academic essays, then buying an essay as a model
                  answer may be the right course for you.

                  Once you have decided to buy an essay - and before starting
                  any kind of order process - you should follow the checklist
                  below to ensure that you have considered all the implications
                  before entering into any kind of contract or making payment:

                    4. Get together any supporting information from your course

                    When you are happy that you have all the information you
                    need to proceed with buying an essay, then it's important to
                    spend some time researching the companies available to see
                    if they fit your needs. The section below on "{" "}

                  When comparing the costs of buying an essay, it is important
                  to understand that there is a very clear distinction between
                  prices for a suitably qualified academic writer, and the
                  prices advertised by a company who are using unqualified
                  writers who may simply be copying content from the web or
                  handbooks. The table below should help to filter out those
                  companies that are not offering credible services:

                <hr />
                <img src="/assets/why-buy.jpg" alt="" className="w-100" />
                <p>
                  Writing an academic essay is an acquired skill; no-one is born
                  knowing how to write an essay, and if you have not been taught
                  the correct way to write and reference academically, then you
                  may be facing a daunting task. Buying an essay as a model
                  answer can help to illustrate the correct way to academically
                  write and reference, and because the work is written to your
                  specific instructions, it is easy for you to see how the model
                  answer applies to your specific essay question. Typically, a
                  student will only need to buy one or two model essays before
                  they understand how to write and reference work themselves.
                  <br />
                  Once you have the skills, you can begin to create your own
                  work from scratch. If you are worried about submitting the
                  work, then using a Marking / Proofreading Service first can
                  highlight areas of improvement without the embarrassment of
                  receiving negative feedback from your lecturer. Typically,
                  costs for marking services are far lower than the cost of
                  buying an essay.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-info">Advantages of Buying an Essay</h2>
                <p>
                  Many students who have bought an essay have found that having
                  a well-written and referenced piece of work, written on a
                  specific topic, can help them to understand how to approach
                  writing an essay themselves. Many people learn best by
                  following an example, and the way that essay writing skills
                  are taught in universities don't necessarily work well for
                  them. <br /> <br />
                  Another advantage of buying an essay is that you get to learn
                  from another professional whose time is dedicated to you,
                  unlike at a university where you may never get any one-on-one
                  time with your lecturer.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-info">Disadvantages of Buying an Essay</h2>
                <p>
                  The biggest disadvantage of buying an essay is missing out on
                  real understanding if you do not re-write the work yourself.
                  Simply handing in a bought essay as your own gives you no
                  benefit: you do not learn the subject matter, you aren't aware
                  of the sources that are referenced, and in the end, you
                  devalue yourself as a future employee. Doing so is also
                  dishonest and is classed as academic misconduct, which can
                  have serious consequences for you in your academic career.{" "}
                  <br /> <br />
                  Another disadvantage of buying an essay over writing your own
                  original work is the cost; after all, professionally written
                  essays require time and expertise to prepare, and these skills
                  come at a cost. <br /> <br />
                  Finally, universities have wildly differing policies on
                  students buying essays: even if the work has been completely
                  re-written and referenced, your university may still see the
                  act of buying an essay as a lack of academic integrity. It is
                  important to be sure about where your institution stands on
                  this practice.

                  Legitimate companies have a number of identifying features
                  that make them stand out from the crowd. From displaying a
                  geographic phone number to appearing on Google StreetView,
                  there are numerous factors that should reassure you that you
                  are dealing with a reputable company before you make decide to
                  buy an essay from them.
                </p>
                <h2 className="text-danger">Understanding the Terminology</h2>
                <p>
                  There are various types of companies and individuals that
                  provide custom-written essays. The type of supplier you choose
                  depends on your reasons for buying an essay. The three most
                  common types of supplier providing custom written essays are:
                </p>
                <div className="ms-3">
                  <p>
                    <span className="text-danger">Essay Mill</span> - The term
                    "essay mill" refers to a company that sells essays in bulk.
                    Usually, these type of companies re-sell the same work to
                    multiple students, with much of the work being sourced
                    directly from the web or printed materials. Over recent
                    years, the term has been used to describe any type of
                    organisation selling academic work, no matter how the work
                    is produced. The term is now used primarily as a slur by the
                    press to describe companies who they believe help students
                    to gain an unfair advantage.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span className="text-danger">Essay Writing Service</span> - Unlike "essay mills", an "essay writing service" produces bespoke (or custom) essays for large numbers of individual students. These types of organisation typically have a large infrastructure and specialise in producing high-quality work that has been double-checked by professional proof-readers and quality checkers.
                  </p>
                  <p>
                    <span className="text-danger">Ghostwriter</span> - This term refers to individuals who write work for another person with the intention of that work being submitted as the purchaser's own work. Using a ghostwriter is almost always considered to be academic dishonesty, as the intention is to disguise the ghostwritten work as your own.
