                      In the first stage, we simply need to know your required
                      grade, expected word count, dissertation subject area and
                      when you would like the work delivered. Be sure to give
                      yourself enough time to write your own work in accordance
                      with our <a href="#">Fair Use Policy</a>! We ask for some
                      contact details at this point so we can get in touch with

                      any specific requirements for the structure of your
                      dissertation. There's also an opportunity to attach your

                <p>
                  The literature review will identify past research on your
                  chosen topic. It will examine published journal articles,
                  books and other types of sources to identify key themes and
                  determine a 'gap' in the existing research. Many dissertations
                  are entirely literature-based. If you are looking for a

                <p>
                  The methodology chapter is vital to your dissertation. The
                  purpose of this section is to say what you want to find out
                  and how you are going to do it. It outlines the research
                  paradigm and methods that you have chosen to use in your
                  research, as well as decisions you have made in terms of the
                  sampling and analysis of the data. Each of these decisions
                  need to be properly justified so that it is clear your methods
                  match the aims and objectives of your research. <br /> <br />
                  If you haven't yet decided what research method you would like
                  to use, our researchers will happily look at your research
                  topic and decide which is most suitable.

                <p>
                  A results chapter is usually included when your dissertation
                  involves collecting data. This chapter outlines your findings
                  and presents your data, often using tables and figures, in
                  relation to each question or theme. It is also where any
                  statistical testing is done so that we can see how significant
                  the results were. We have many writers who are familiar with
                  statistical software such as SPSS or STATA and are ready to
                  help with this part.

                  A discussion chapter compares your results with other research
                  on the subject to work out what we have learned and what it
                  means for the future. It talks about whether old research has
                  been confirmed or contradicted, any new theories or
                  explanations that might have emerged, and what the results
                  might mean for policy and practice.

                  The conclusion chapter is typically around 10% of the word
                  count. It summarises what was done, the key findings of the
                  research, and your recommendations - it needs to be clear and
                  to the point.

                  We can help with many other 'extras' that you may require. For
                  example, dissertations often require an abstract, which is a
                  short summary of the entire dissertation that is not factored
                  into the final word count. Designing research instruments can
                  also be very difficult, so our writers can create interview
                  questions or sample questionnaires to assist you in conducting
                  your research.
