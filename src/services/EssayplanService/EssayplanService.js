          <p className="mb-5">
            Essay Plans are great for helping you to stay focused on the main
            points of your work. Once you have been sent your outline, all you
            need to do is flesh it out to make a full essay. We have given you
            the structure and resources to write your essay, so you need to
            follow these to develop your ideas and arguments.

                </h3>
                <p>
                  Start by reading through the plan a couple of times, making
                  sure you locate and read the references used to enhance your
                  knowledge and background reading. You should then develop the
                  main points and think critically about the arguments the
                  writer has given you.

                    Control and After Care teams. Our in-house team read through
                    each piece of work to make sure that it follows your
                    requirements and will suit your needs. We recognise the need
                    to get things right, first time and every time, and we work
                    hard to deliver a great service, taking the time to check
                    each order against your instructions. With each essay plan,
                    we will also send you a unique quality report â€“ written just
                    for you - and a plagiarism report so you can verify that the
                    work our writer has provided is 100% original and has been
