              <h2>Quality Control at UK Essays</h2>
              <p>
                We know that when you order a custom piece of work you expect
                perfection. The truth is, unfortunately, that most companies
                don't always live up to their promises and enticing guarantees.
                In fact, under UK law, a guarantee doesn't even mean your order
                will be problem-free; it simply means that if something goes
                wrong, the company will repair or replace goods that don't meet
                the standard agreed. When it comes to a custom essay, however,
                getting the work corrected or your money back just isn't enough;
                it's all about getting things right first time. <br /> <br />
                Every step we take at UK Essays is to produce fantastic quality
                work, that always aims to meet your specific needs and
                requirements. See for yourself:

            Here at UK Essays, our success has been built on the quality of the
            work that we deliver. We've been operating since 2003 and our
            experience has taught us that, ultimately, getting your work
            completed to the quality you expect on time is what you really want.
            Whilst this might not sound like much, it does takes a lot of hard
            work to deliver. We work hard at every stage of your order to ensure
            the quality is exactly what you need.

                  Every single order goes through rigorous quality control and
                  is checked against your instructions and academic standards by
                  qualified professionals. We take the time with each order to
                  complete a comprehensive quality report, which we release to
                  you upon completion of your order.

                <p>
                  We insist that the writer who works for you must have studied
                  in the same country where you are studying. This means that,
                  if you’re studying in London, then you’ll only ever have a
                  writer who studied in the UK completing your work. In depth,
                  hands-on knowledge of a country's academic system is essential
                  in the completion of your work, so even if someone got a 1st
                  from Cambridge, we won’t trust them to complete an
                  Undergraduate B grade order for a student at the University of
                  Melbourne.

                  that has brought us our success and ask for feedback from you
                  on every single piece of work that you receive. Even now we

                  Sometimes things go wrong - it's bound to happen when you
                  deliver such a tailored product. Here at UK Essays, however,
                  we've dedicated additional resources to ensuring that, when
                  things go wrong, we resolve them promptly and, in the vast
                  majority of cases, this occurs before you even see the work.
                  Our dedicated Quality Control and After Care teams have been
                  developed to ensure every order is delivered to our
                  high-quality expectations. Our Quality Control team review
                  every piece of work and our After Care team are waiting to

                  account management system. This allows us to keep track of
                  your order, chase it promptly and communicate with you
                  effectively. We've dedicated almost 8,000 days of programmer's
                  time coding our system to ensure you get exactly what you
                  expect when it comes to your order's due date.

            Unlike some of our competitors, we're very transparent about the
            recruitment of our writers. We don't make any ridiculous claims,
            such as all of our writers being from the University of Oxford or
            Cambridge University. Instead, we ensure that your writer is always
            qualified at or above the level you have ordered; we check that they
            are who they say they are; and, finally, we ensure that they are
            capable of delivering the level of work we expect through
            appropriate testing during the recruitment process.

                  All of our writers hold at least an undergraduate 2:1 standard
                  degree, with the greater number of them holding master's level
                  qualifications. We always assign a writer qualified at or
                  above the grade you ordered, so if you order a masters
                  Distinction, you don't need to worry about your writer's

                  When recruiting our writers, we're very careful to make sure
                  that they are who they say they are. We check the documents we
                  receive against a photo ID of the individual and a recent
                  utility bill to ensure they are exactly who they say they are
                  and truly hold the correct qualifications. Alongside this, we
                  expect correct contact details and we call new writers before
                  providing them with work. Fraudsters providing fake documents
                  in order to obtain freelance writing work is common due to our
                  attractive rates, so we train our team to make sure such

                  guarantee the quality of their academic writing and attention
                  to detail. We check the quality of writing in everything we
                  receive from potential writers, all the way down to a thorough
                  proofreading of their application itself. New researchers are

            custom writing service, then you'll be reassured to hear that we're

            maintain a large internal team of quality control staff as well as
            making use of external specialists to ensure your work is checked by
            a subject-specific academic expert.

              <Accordion.Body>
                If your assignment asked for a report, then the structure is
                crucial, as a report delivered as an essay would result in a
                fail. The flow and presentation of an essay also contribute
                dramatically to the grade you receive. Technical accuracy can
                easily be overshadowed by poor presentation, so we check
                presentation and flow thoroughly to ensure your work is
                displayed in the best way possible. Signposting is also a vital
                skill in producing academic work, as it tells the reader about
                the context of your essay rather than just the content (for
                example, making the reader aware of what the essay explores or
                leading into the arguments that are about to follow).

                The referencing style used is an essential requirement of your

                also check the quality of the sources used. This involves
                checking each source to ensure it's the most relevant and
                up-to-date source available. We also check there are enough
                references in the work and that there is the expected variety of
                sources, including sources from journals, books, newspapers and
                all other relevant sources where appropriate.

              <Accordion.Body>
                The quality of your essay ultimately comes down to
                subject-specific content and the technical accuracy of your
                work. Often, work drops in standard due to being descriptive
                rather than critical. We ensure the work we produce fully
                evaluates the arguments and evidence available, presents a
                balanced view of other writers' conclusions as well as including
                a unique conclusion of its own, and provides a view of the
